Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon :, whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’.

A Dictionary in Python works similar to the Dictionary in a real world. Keys of a Dictionary must be unique and of immutable data type such as Strings, Integers, and tuples, but the key-values can be repeated and be of any type.
